In this repo I prepared two single cell sequences pipelines, one for scTCR-seq data analysis; anther for scRNA-DEA analysis
For more complex experiment, I will prepare later

C. For more complex experiment design and data integration, which involves multiple data modalities—such as scRNA-seq, surface protein (e.g., CITE-seq/ADT), and AIRR (adaptive immune receptor) data—and possibly multiple samples or even experiments, need to plan for integration at several levels.
