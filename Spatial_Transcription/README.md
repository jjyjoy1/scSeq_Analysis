I've created a comprehensive Snakemake pipeline for analyzing 10x Genomics Visium spatial transcriptomics data. Here's a summary of what I've provided:

Main Snakemake Pipeline - Defines the complete workflow from FASTQ files to final results, including QC, Space Ranger processing, and multiple analysis paths.
R Analysis Scripts:

Seurat Analysis Script - For spatial clustering, finding marker genes, and identifying spatially variable features using R/Seurat.
Spatial Deconvolution Script - Uses SPOTlight to estimate cell type compositions in spatial data.
Pathway Analysis Script - Performs GO, KEGG, and Reactome pathway enrichment on marker genes.


Python Analysis Script:

Scanpy Analysis Script - Alternative/complementary analysis using Python's Scanpy and Squidpy packages.


Final Report Template - An R Markdown template that generates a comprehensive HTML report of all analysis results.
Configuration File - YAML template for setting up your specific project parameters.


Review Results:

QC reports in results/qc/
Space Ranger outputs in results/spaceranger/
Seurat analysis in results/seurat/
Scanpy analysis in results/scanpy/
Cell type deconvolution in results/final_results/deconvolution_results.csv
Pathway analysis in results/final_results/pathway_analysis.csv
Comprehensive report in results/final_results/final_report.html



Key Features of This Pipeline

Dual Analysis Approaches - Uses both R/Seurat and Python/Scanpy for robust analysis
Quality Control - Rigorous QC at each step
Cell Type Deconvolution - Estimates cellular composition of spatial spots
Pathway Analysis - Identifies enriched biological processes
Comprehensive Reporting - Generates detailed HTML report of all findings
Scalable - Handles single or multiple samples with automatic integration
Customizable - Parameters easily adjusted via configuration file

This pipeline follows best practices for spatial transcriptomics analysis and provides a complete solution from raw data to interpretable biological insights. The modular design allows you to customize specific steps as needed for your specific research questions.

The pipeline I created for 10x Genomics Visium can be adapted for these other platforms with some modifications.

Shared Components Across Platforms

Core Analysis Components:

QC metrics calculation
Normalization
Dimensionality reduction
Clustering
Differential expression
Spatial variable gene detection
Cell type deconvolution
Pathway analysis
Visualization


Common Data Structures:

All platforms generate gene expression matrices
All have spatial coordinates for each spot/bead/pixel
All require integration with tissue images

For Slide-seq and Slide-seq V2
Slide-seq uses DNA-barcoded beads at higher resolution (~10μm) than Visium (~100μm).

Modifications needed:

Data Processing: Replace Space Ranger with Slide-seq-specific preprocessing (their MATLAB/Python scripts)
Coordinate System: Higher density spatial coordinates
Visualization: Adjust point sizing in plots due to higher density
Additional QC: Need to filter based on Slide-seq-specific QC metrics

For BGI Stereo-seq
Stereo-seq offers much higher resolution spatial profiling (subcellular/~1μm), resulting in much larger datasets.
Modifications needed:

Data Processing: Replace Space Ranger with the spateo/stereopy pipeline
Memory Management: Add chunking for larger matrices
Binning: Add step to bin data at different resolutions for multi-scale analysis
Visualization: Add specific plotting functions for multi-resolution data

Most of the analysis pipeline after preprocessing can be shared across platforms. The main differences are in:

Initial data preprocessing: Each platform has its own raw data format and tools
Resolution parameters: Adjust neighborhood sizes, clustering resolution based on spot/bead density
Visualization: Adjust point sizes and other visual parameters
Memory handling: Higher resolution platforms require more efficient memory management
