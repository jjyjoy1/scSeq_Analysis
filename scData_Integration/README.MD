# This repository contains implementations and examples for three deep learning models applied to single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis:

## DCCA (Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis)

Single-cell multi-omics data, such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell epigenomics (e.g., scATAC-seq), provide comprehensive molecular profiles of individual cells, enabling the characterization of cellular heterogeneity and regulatory programs. However, the integration of these data is challenging due to differences in sparsity, heterogeneity, and dimensionality. DCCA, proposed by Zuo et al. in 2021, addresses these challenges by combining variational autoencoders (VAEs) and attention-transfer mechanisms, specifically designed for joint analysis of such data.


## GLUER (Graph Linked Unified Embedding)
GLUE is a computational method designed to integrate multiple types of single-cell data, particularly focusing on single-cell multi-omics and multiplex imaging data.

## scGPT (Single-cell Generative Pre-trained Transformer)
s a specialized model for single-cell genomics that applies transformer architecture principles to single-cell RNA sequencing data.
scGPT is designed to learn representations of gene expression patterns across individual cells.
