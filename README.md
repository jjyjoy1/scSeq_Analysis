I've created a comprehensive pipeline for single-cell RNA sequencing analysis with implementations in both Python and R, focusing on the requirements for batch integration, normalization, clustering, and differential expression analysis.
What I've Provided

I also prepared scripts for TCR/BCR single cell data analysis and spatial transcriptomics data analysis. 

In the meantime, I summaried three scData integration deep learning models, which contain basic usages, model performance evaluation and visualization. 

Python Implementation (Scanpy + scVI)

A complete modular pipeline built with Scanpy and scVI
Handles data loading, QC, normalization, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and marker identification
Implements VAE-based batch correction and Bayesian differential expression
Processes multiple datasets simultaneously and removes batch effects
Quantifies uncertainty in gene expression through the VAE model


R Implementation (Seurat + Harmony)

A complementary pipeline using Seurat and Harmony
Provides similar functionality but with R's robust statistical methods
Includes cell type annotation, visualization, and differential expression using MAST


Custom VAE Implementation

A detailed PyTorch implementation of a variational autoencoder for scRNA-seq
Models gene expression as negative binomial distributions
Provides uncertainty quantification for differential expression
Includes comprehensive visualization functions for results


Comprehensive Guide

A tutorial explaining how to use both implementations
Tips for parameter selection and interpretation
Comparison of different integration and analysis methods

Key Features
Integration of Batches/Experiments
Both pipelines effectively integrate data from multiple experiments/batches:

Python: Uses scVI's VAE architecture to create a joint embedding
R: Uses Harmony for batch correction in the PCA space

Normalization and Denoising
Multiple approaches are included:

Library size normalization with log transformation
SCTransform in the R pipeline
Model-based normalization with the VAE

Dimensionality Reduction for Visualization

PCA for initial reduction
VAE latent space for integrated representation (Python)
Harmony-corrected PCA (R)
UMAP for visualization

Clustering

Graph-based clustering with Leiden algorithm (Python)
Shared nearest neighbor clustering (R)
Adjustable resolution parameter

Differential Expression Analysis

Standard Wilcoxon tests
Bayesian differential expression through VAE sampling (Python)
MAST for zero-inflated models (R)
Uncertainty quantification in the Python implementation
